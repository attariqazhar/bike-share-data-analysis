# ðŸš´ Bike Sharing Data Dashboard ðŸš´
A data analysis project to analyse the trend of bike share during 2011-2012. In this project, I analysed the peak times (hours and months) of bike rentals within 2011-2012 and also the correlation between the weather and the amount of bike rentals. I also tried to dig dipper into the distribution of bike rental in each season. To find out more about the data visualization, you can check the notebok and the attached link.
